Witnesses say that someone broke into a room of the apartment. Many things are missing including a bag filled with $100k. Find out the truth and who broke into the apartment.
There were no sounds of doors or windows breaking. I heard some loud rifling noises. I also heard someone footsteps in hallway after, kind of sneaking footstep.
I'm the owner of that bag. It was Friday, I was hanging out with my friend. I think it should be someone that live here because he broke into my room while I was away.
While I was reading a magazine inside my room. I heard a tinkering sound so I opened the door to find the source. I saw someone run to the back door quickly.
