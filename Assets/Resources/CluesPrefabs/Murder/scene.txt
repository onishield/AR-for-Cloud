I heard two men arguing really loud for a few minutes. After a while it all stopped for a moment and then a thundering shot and then silence.
I saw some shadows movement behide the curtains. What I saw is two figures wrestle and then I think I saw one big dude take out a gun and shoot the poor guy.
I was listening to some really loud music so I couldn't hear much. I think there was screaming, maybe a woman was involved.
